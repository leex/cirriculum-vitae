        <p>I moved from Whakatane to Auckland when I was 16 to begin University after year 12. I did this as an alternative to year 13 as I felt that high school didn’t have much to offer.</p>
        <p>During my time at AUT University I worked part time at Telecom NZ on the broadband help desk, this provided my first insight into the corporate environment and professional work.</p>
        <p>Near the end of study I began working for Kiwi Online. My friend’s dad had started this company from scratch and needed a help desk for the first few customers coming online. So I provided dial up technical support from my dorm telephone.</p>
        <p>After graduating without failing any papers I started work at Kiwi Online again, this time the help desk was more permanent and I played an influential role with processes and call management. Alongside this I designed the main website which was a portal site designed for Kiwi’s. This was taken down shortly after going live when Kiwi Online was sold to Orcon, which is when I finished my employment with them.</p>
        <p>I wanted to do more with websites and programming so it felt natural to move away from the help desk. My uncles business software needed an update and it was custom built. The software they used at S.S.Shapley was running on MSDOS with some sort of very old database which thankfully had a handy export tool. I spent some time and brought their system into a MYSQL/PHP/HTML environment, some might agree that this is sinful for product management software. Alas, it was a cheap solid solution for the business and they are happy to this day with everything.</p>
        <p>Moving back to Auckland after work in Whakatane I landed a job at Telstraclear Customer Help which is the technical support department at Telstraclear. I quickly moved up to a second level support position and have enjoyed many many good times here. I have learned more than I could have ever hoped, just not all what I planned to learn. Progressing in this environment was not desired and I probably lingered in the role for too long, good colleagues can sometimes make a job too good!</p>
