      <h3>Drupal</h3>

        <p>I started developing with Drupal in late 2010 with my first project being Drupal 6. This was also my last D6 project before moving into D7 nearly soon as it was released. In hindsight it was maybe not right to jump into D7 straight away but it was manageable. I've now completed development of several D7 sites and am very confident with the platform, though there are definitely always things to learn.</p>

        <p>I'm a big fan of Drupal for many reasons. Primarily I'm an advocate of open source software. I believe the open source model is a great way to develop as it encourages community and sharing. You don't have the extra layer of complexity where you worry about locking things down so ideas can't be stolen, everything flows freely. This topic moves me into the contrib aspects of Drupal which I think are great, sharing modules, themes and distributions makes Drupal very powerful in it's scope, what it can provide for the developer and ultimately the client.</p>

        <p>Thirdly, I love Drupalers, I don't think I've met a Drupal developer who isn't a nice happy person who loves to share their work and ideas with others. This is how I like to live my life and why I support and love open source. The Drupal community is just great. I try to hangout on Drupal IRC as often as I can to help others and of course ask for guidance. I have hosted a Drupal meetup event and very much enjoy attending these.</p>

      <h3 id="drupal">Web Development</h3>

        <p>I've been doing Web Development on and off my whole life and fulltime for the past 4 years. I consider myself an intermediate developer and am working toward becoming a senior. I have experience across a range of technologies and a solid understanding of the web development process. I don't have any experience however with Agile development and this is something I'm very keen to learn about.</p>

        <p>I know it's hard to express talent with regards to technologies because many developers overstate their skillset as they are unaware of how big the pool of knowledge actually is. I work primarily with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and jQuery. I am very confident with HTML and CSS. I am reasonable with jQuery/javascript, PHP and SQL. I'm a quick learner and if I'm not particularly skilled with something it's due to a lack of exposure rather than an inability to learn or retain information.</p>

        <p>I am proficient with most web development related software such as the Adobe suite and most Microsoft Office software. I prefer to use Google Documents and GMail.</p>

        <p>One thing I'll be doing in the future is moving away from MySQL and towards PostgreSQL as MySQL is no longer a fully open source DBMS. Very recently Oracle changed the license of the MySQL man pages to closed source instead of GPL, very worrying and telling of the future of this software.</p>

        <p>I have experience with Drupal, Wordpress, Prestashop and OSCommerce.</p>

          <h4>Jiminy <small>November 2010 - June 2013</small></h4>

          <p>When I started working with Jiminy it was just two people. My initial job description was to build websites based off design files, using appropriate technologies. Mostly HTML/CSS/Javascript and PHP/MySQL. I worked closely with one of the owners Che building sites using Wordpress. Eventually as we took on bigger more demanding clients we started using Drupal.</p>

          <p>Since then I’ve branched out from development to reach into other parts of the website development process, mainly usability, architecture and training. Eventually when we took on more developers I became lead of the development team of three people. I really enjoy many aspects of website development and have a good understanding of what’s required to deliver a successful product.</p>

          <p>I decided to take a break and stop contracting with Jiminy. The main reason for this is that my personal growth path fell out of alignment with the business's path. I'm happy to elaborate on this but like most situations, things were complicated.</p>

          <h4>TelstraClear <small>September 2006 - November 2010</small></h4>

          <p>I started as a 1st level support agent in September and progressed to a 2nd level role after 7 months. This role involves supporting 1st level agents, on site technicians, contractors and business managers. I learned a lot about customer service during my years at Telstraclear.</p>

          <h4>S.S.Shapley Plumbing Supplies <small>April 2006 - August 2006</small></h4>

          <p>S.S.Shapley plumbing needed to upgrade their legacy P.O.S and billing software. I was able to bring the database and interface into the 21st century converting system functionality from a DOS platform to a modern PHP/mysql platform. Since then I have also created an ecommerce site which I designed and developed. Budget was tight and I wish I could have done more, this site is online @ <a href="http://pinkplumbingshop.co.nz/">http://pinkplumbingshop.co.nz/</a></p>

          <h4>Kiwi Online <small>March 2005 - April 2006</small></h4>

          <p>I worked for Kiwi Online during it’s first year. I was the original support agent taking calls from my university dorm phone, before there was even an office! When the company grew I managed the support department and created the website. Eventually Kiwi Online was sold to Orcon ISP and I parted ways.</p>
